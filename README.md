## Sounds Included

* Half life
* Old Minecraft Death Sound
* Lego Yoda Death
* AUUUUUUGHHH

## Why I made this?
After Roblox changed the oof sound I started to replace it with custom sounds like AUUUUUUGHHH and the Vine Boom Sound Effect, I wanted an easier way to change the death sound. So I made this app. Also to help other people easily change their oof sound.

## How does it work?
The custom death sounds are stored in the "sounds" folder in an OGG file format and are copied into the Roblox Game files to replace the oof sound.
