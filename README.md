## Sounds Included

## Why I made this?
After Roblox changed the oof sound I started to replace it with custom sounds like AUUUUUUGHHH and the Vine Boom Sound Effect, I wanted an easier way to change the death sound. So I made this app. Also to help other people easily change their oof sound.

## How does it work?
The custom death sounds are stored in the "sounds" folder (downloaded as a zip file then extracted automatically by the program) in an OGG file format and are copied into the Roblox Game files to replace the oof sound.
